# Student-Data-Collection
### Excel macro project

❗A small GIFT 🎁📦@ The end of post
from myself to all the Teachers / Recruiters / Coursegivers, Students or whoever needs to collect Student / Candidate data. ❗

Here is a simple... (yet not so simple to make!😂) Form sheet 📊📈.
This is a wonderful, well-rounded, and automated Form-sheet.
Just fill in the date and take advantage of the example tab if required.
Click the [Submit-Form] button✅ and Walaa!!!🎇 Automated data is gathered in the backend. 📉💹

Wanna check? Go to the Data-Table Tab for your automated records.
Feel free to connect‍‍‍‍‍‍‍ with me if you want to know more about this wonderful use of macros for automated forms and data gathering tricks in Excel.
